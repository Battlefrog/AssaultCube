# Cubytes
A simple action game about avoiding the walls and collecting points while going to the exit.

Cubytes is made with the Chili Framework, which license is here:

This repo is old news at this point, as I'm currently expanding this game in Godot 3.
The link to that repo is [here](https://github.com/Battlefrog/Cubytes-Godot).

Therefore, this project is indefinitely postponed until further notice.
